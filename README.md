> Exam Answer Paper Valuation and Marksheet Generation using AI

Our application streamlines the grading process for educational institutions, specifically designed for professors and teachers. Upon registration, educators can effortlessly create a valuation form, representing the specific exam they intend to assess. They have the flexibility to upload both the question paper and the criteria, serving as the answer key for evaluating responses.

Once this foundation is laid, teachers can seamlessly upload batches of answer papers in various formats, including PDF or images. The AI takes the lead at this stage, utilizing computer vision to recognize and analyze handwritten responses. By comparing these answers against the provided criteria, the AI assigns marks to each question, significantly streamlining the grading process.

Following this initial evaluation, teachers have the opportunity to review the marks assigned by the AI. The system provides remarks, explaining the rationale behind each mark, and displays a progress indicator in red, green, or yellow to indicate the AI's confidence level in its assessment. Teachers can then make adjustments to the marks manually or request the AI to reevaluate a specific question by providing additional context.

Finally, teachers can export the overall marklist of the students, which includes the evaluated marks. The export feature supports various formats such as PDF, CSV, providing educators with a versatile tool for managing and comprehensively assessing student performance.

In essence, our application seamlessly integrates advanced technology to automate and enhance the efficiency of traditional paper-grading systems, empowering educators with a robust tool for managing and evaluating student performance.
